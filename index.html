<p align="left"><b>Saravanan Sivakumar</b>(born 23 July 1975), known professionally as <b>Suriya</b>, is an Indian actor and film producer who primarily works in Tamil films. One of the highest-paid Tamil actors, Suriya is considered as one of the finest actors of Indian cinema. Suriya has received numerous accolades including two National Film Awards, six Filmfare Awards South and five Tamil Nadu State Film Awards. He has featured six times in Forbes India's Celebrity 100 list.After making his debut in Nerukku Ner (1997) at the age of 22, Suriya landed his breakthrough role in Nandhaa (2001) and then had his first major commercial success with the thriller Kaakha Kaakha (2003). Following award-winning performances of a conman in Pithamagan (2003) and a hunchback in Perazhagan (2004), he played a man suffering from anterograde amnesia in the 2005 blockbuster Ghajini. He rose to stardom with dual roles of a father and son in Gautham Vasudev Menon's semi-autobiographical Vaaranam Aayiram (2008). His status as an action star was established with roles of a smuggler in Ayan (2009), and an aggressive cop in the Singam trilogy. He also found success with the science fiction films 7 Aum Arivu (2011) and 24 (2016) and then went on to work in critically acclaimed films like Soorarai Pottru (2020) and Jai Bhim (2021), the former of which earned him the National Film Award for Best Actor.
Suriya is the elder son of actor Sivakumar and his younger brother Karthi is also an actor. In 2006, he married actress Jyothika whom he co-starred with in 7 films. He began Agaram Foundation, which funds various philanthropic activities, later that year.
<br>
He is one of the most celebrated and influential actors in Tamil cinema, known for his versatility, intense screen presence, and commitment to delivering meaningful as well as entertaining films. Making his debut in 1997 with Nerrukku Ner, Suriya initially faced a slow start in his career but quickly evolved into a bankable star through hard work and carefully chosen scripts. His breakthrough came with Nandha (2001), where his powerful portrayal of a misunderstood young man garnered critical acclaim and opened doors to challenging roles. Following this, Kaakha Kaakha (2003), directed by Gautham Vasudev Menon, established him as a leading action hero, and his romantic entertainer Pithamagan alongside Vikram showcased his ability to share screen space while delivering impactful performances. In 2005, Suriya‚Äôs Ghajini, directed by A.R. Murugadoss, became a massive blockbuster, with his performance as a man suffering from short-term memory loss being praised across industries. This role not only expanded his reach beyond Tamil audiences but also inspired a Bollywood remake, further cementing his pan-Indian appeal.
<br>
Suriya is known for his method acting‚Äîhe undergoes intense physical and emotional preparation for his roles. For Soorarai Pottru, he lost weight and adopted the mannerisms of a real-life aviation pioneer; for Vaadivaasal, he has been training in bull-taming techniques to authentically portray the sport of jallikattu. His voice modulation, expressive eyes, and ability to shift between soft-spoken charm and fiery intensity have made him a director‚Äôs favorite.
